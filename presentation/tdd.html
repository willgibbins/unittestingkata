      # Unit Tests: why we do it
      ![I Find Your Lack of Tests Disturbing](https://jfiaffe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/lack-of-testing.jpg)

      ???

      * Ensures the code does what we said it was going to do.
      * Documents the code.
        * Comments become obsolete quickly
        * Tests live
      * Should not require human intervention.

      # Unit Tests: making quality tests

      ![QA Approved](http://coavainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/quality.jpg)

      ???

      * Consistent, no spurious failures
        * Fragility is bad
        * Integration tests are an example of fragile.  Shouldn't be primary tool.
      * A single logical assert per unit test.

      ---

      # Unit Tests: naming patterns

      * method_conditions_result
      * testMethodExpectedAction

      ???

      * Should be named for intention and expectations. SELF DOCUMENTING.
      * Use a naming pattern to improve readability.
      * A pattern reduces the amount of time you waste thinking about what to test.

      # TDD: never trust the code

      # TDD: What Is It

      ???
      * Unit Test written before the code to define functionality
      * Defines "DONE" when tests for the feature are all passing.

      ---

      # TDD: Advantages
      ???

      * Prevents "Gold Plating"
      * Allows you to quickly work in new languages and technology
      * Produces cleaner, more testable code.

      ---

      # TDD: How To Do It
      ???
      * Test the smallest thing possible. Reduces fragility (See Mocking)
      * Only write one test at a time. Stay focused on the immediate.
      * Focus on class behavior
      * Don't test implementation
      * Write only enough code to pass the test, no more.

      ---
      # TDD

      * Breaks down complex problems into small discrete steps.  A test should be focused minimalistically.
